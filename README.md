# KrakenGate ‚Äì Remote Control for Legacy Radios

**KrakenGate** is a **spin-off of [KrakenRelay](https://github.com/AmericanSquid/KrakenRelay)** designed for **remote operation of legacy radios** over the internet using [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info).

It‚Äôs currently in **testing / development**, so expect rough edges.

KrakenGate reuses:

* The **`ptt_controller` module** directly from KrakenRelay (CM108 HID PTT control).
* A **modified version of the old, deprecated Mumble interface** from KrakenRelay, adapted into a standalone `MumbleBridge`.

---

## ‚ú® Purpose

Many older or ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù radios don‚Äôt support native network control or digital modes.
KrakenGate gives you a way to:

* Listen to your station‚Äôs audio anywhere via Mumble.
* Key your transmitter remotely with hardware PTT.
* Feed audio back into the radio so remote users can transmit through it.

Essentially, it‚Äôs an RF-to-internet bridge built from a Raspberry Pi and a DigiRig interface.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Two-way audio bridging**

  * **Radio RX ‚Üí Mumble**: captures audio from the radio and streams it to a Mumble channel.
  * **Mumble ‚Üí Radio TX**: plays remote Mumble audio into the radio when PTT is keyed.

* **Hardware PTT with CM108**

  * Keys/unkeys a USB CM108 interface (or DigiRig Lite) on a defined GPIO pin.

* **Web UI + REST API**

  * PTT button + spacebar control.
  * Real-time RX/TX meters.
  * JSON status API for integration/monitoring.

* **Secure tunneling**

  * Web server is meant to run behind SSH tunnel or VPN.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status

This is **experimental**.
It‚Äôs being tested as a lightweight, single-purpose bridge, separate from KrakenRelay‚Äôs larger feature set.
Expect:

* Breaking changes.
* Incomplete error handling.
* Bugs carried over from the legacy Mumble interface.

---

## üóÇ Requirements

* Linux host (Raspberry Pi recommended).
* **Legacy/analog radio** with:

  * Audio in/out connected to a USB soundcard.
  * PTT control via CM108 HID device (e.g. DigiRig Lite).
* Python 3.9+.

Python deps:

```bash
pip install sounddevice flask pymumble-py3 python-dotenv numpy
```

## üöÄ Running

```bash
python3 remote_trx.py
```

Access from your browser:

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for the dashboard.

* Click/hold the button or press **spacebar** for PTT.
* Watch RX/TX meters update in real time.

## üîÆ Roadmap / Known Gaps

* Refine error handling and reconnection logic.
* Reconcile TX/RX audio level reporting.
* Cleanup leftover legacy code from KrakenRelay‚Äôs Mumble interface.
